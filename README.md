## Spatial

### An experimental 3D engine written entirely in C.

#### Explaination

Spatial will (hopefully) be an experimental 3D engine written from scratch entirely in C. It will use the SDL library for graphical integration with POSIX operating systems. All rendering will be done in software, with the geometry of the world rotated around an immobile camera.

#### Goals

The goal of this project is to familiarize myself with the SDL API as well as flex my understanding of the mathematics required to project, transform, and rotate 3-dimensional space onto a 2-dimensional plane.
